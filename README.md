# State Endangered SpeciesÂ 

<img src ="demo.png">

This application gives a brief overview of conservation efforts in every state in the U.S.

It contains two visualizations of states' conservation efforts.

In the first, we see a clear depiction of states stack up against one another in terms of conservation.

In the second chart, we see a map which demonstrated in color which states have the most substantive restrictions for conservation. 

## About

This app was my first built in R. 

R is a statistical programming language used by many science because of its vectorized operations. Though R is certainly not the only programming language that handles large data sets, it does so more effectively than most when it comes to statistical analyses.
