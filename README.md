# [Conservation Laws By State](https://sashapatsel.github.io/state-endangered-species/)Â 

<img src ="demo.png">
This application gives a brief overview of conservation efforts in every state in the U.S.

It contains two visualizations of states' conservation efforts.

In figure A, we see a clear depiction of how states stack up against one another in terms of conservation. States found on the right side of the chart, or who are represented by a darker shade of blue, rank more strongly. The opposite is true for the left-most and lighter blue states.

In figure B, we see a map demonstrating in color which states have the most substantive restrictions for conservation. In this case, states highlighted in a lighter shade of blue have more substantive restrictions.
